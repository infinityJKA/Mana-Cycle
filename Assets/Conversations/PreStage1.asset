  - '[Year 3248 IR] '
  - '[In the Infinity Realm, technology has progressed far enough that this magic-weiding
    society is able to train using a virtual environment.]'
  - '[This virtual training environment is known as the Infinite Battle Network.] '
  - '[By connecting their bodies through the IBN, upcoming mages are able to train
    in a safe environment, dueling each other and training through otherwise dangerous
    routines without risk.] '
  - "[The IBN quickly became very widespread. And just now, a new group of students
    are trying it out for the first time\u2026] "
  - ...
  - "Woah! I\u2019m actually in the virtual world. "
  - 'I wonder if anyone else arrived yet? '
  - 'Only me so far, looks like the others are still connecting. '
  - '[ ... ]'
  - Ahh!
  - "Oh, I guess I\u2019m here now. "
  - "It really does look like we\u2019re in a computer program, but it doesn\u2019t
    really feel like it."
  - 'Your consciousness is connected to the program, so everything you do here feels
    real, and your technique from training actually pays off. '
  - 'Where did you come from? '
  - 'Logged in while you were screaming. '
  - 'Anyways, what should we do first? It looks like they have a lot of training
    programs. '
  - 'Since this is our first time here, we should probably start out with one of
    the easier exercises. '
  - "Alright, let\u2019s get this started! "
